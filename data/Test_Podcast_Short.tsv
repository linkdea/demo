1801	2601	Can I buy you a drink?
5343	6783	I want to go after the carriage trade.
7384	8524	Present legitimate acts.
9325	10325	Expand our appeal.
10365	11566	Go after the snobs.
13006	15107	If you only knew how suffocating they are...
15127	16148	So come join the circus.
16548	18309	You clearly have a flair for show business.
19850	21390	Teach me how to appeal to the high brows.
22531	23431	Are you serious?
23451	25092	Mm-hmm.
25053	27413	Mr. Barnum, I can't just run off and join the circus.
27473	29254	Why not? Sounds thrilling, doesn't it?
29274	31114	Let's just say that I find it much more comfortable
31194	32654	admiring your show from afar.
32694	34194	Comfort, the enemy of progress.
34214	36595	Do you understand that just associating with you
36615	37855	could cost me my inheritance?
38275	39515	Well, it could cost you more than half.
39975	42276	You'd be risking everything, but on the other hand,
42316	44936	well, you just might find yourself a free man.
50017	52637	Right here, right now, I put the offer out.
53177	54237	I don't want to chase you down. I know you see it.
59997	69945	So trade that typical to something colorful, and if it's crazy, live a little crazy.
70305	76310	You can play it sensible, a king of convention law, or you can risk it all and see.
77912	86759	Don't you want to get away from the same old part you gotta play, cause I got what you need to come with me and take ride.
88239	96505	Because you can do like you do or you can do like me stay in the cage, or you finally take the keys
96985	100507	Oh, yeah, suddenly you're free to fly
100767	103249	It'll take you to the other side
103269	108132	Okay, my friend you want to cut me in late to tell you buddy just wait
110890	115813	I think I'm good to go cuz I quite enjoy the life you say I'm trapped in now
115893	121457	I admire you and that will show you do you're onto something really it's something
121477	126461	I live among the swells and we don't pick up peanut shells. I'll have to leave that up to you
127843	133445	Don't you know that I'm okay with this uptown part I get to play
133605	137787	Cause I got what I need and I don't want to take the ride
137807	141829	And I need to see the other side so go and do like you do
142129	146471	I'm good to do like me, ain't in a cage so I don't need to take the key
146751	148712	Oh damn, can't you see
152405	155506	Now is this really how you'd like to spend your days
155706	158387	Whisky, misery, and parties in place?
158467	161649	If I were mixed up with you, I'd be the talk of the town
161709	164630	Disgraced and disowned, another one of the clowns
164670	168191	But you will finally live a little, finally laugh a little
168591	172273	Just let me give you the freedom to dream and it'll wake you up
172893	174234	And cure your aching
174854	177515	Take your walls and start them breakin'
177915	181256	Now that's a deal that seems worth takin'
182718	185461	But I guess I'll leave that up to you
200177	202578	I'll give you seven, we can shake and make it happen
203279	206181	I wasn't born this morning, eighteen would be just fine
206381	209323	Why not just go ahead and ask for nickels on the dime
209443	210023	Fifteen
210143	212165	I do eight, twelve, maybe nine
212425	212765	Ten
223833	226014	Sir, looks like you have yourself a junior partner
227896	230876	What I have is an overcompensated apprentice.
259417	264165	We're going to the other side, we're going to the other side
